# CONDITIONAL BELIEF UPDATING

This is the overall repository that replicates all analyses from Drevet J, Drugowitsch J, WXyart V (2022) Efficient stabilization of imprecise statistical inference through conditional belief updating https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.495322v1

Participants' Data can be found on figshare:
https://figshare.com/projects/Efficient_stabilization_of_imprecise_statistical_inference_through_conditional_belief_updating/140170

To fit the models, you need to add following code to your path:
     VBMC v1.0 (https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc/)
     BADS v1.0 (https://github.com/lacerbi/bads/)
      
To run the analyses on model fitting results, you need to add following functions to your path:
     spm_BMS.m in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Center for Human Neuroimaging; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm)
     simple_mixed_anova.m (Calpette, L. (2022) https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64980-simple-rm-mixed-anova-for-any-design)
